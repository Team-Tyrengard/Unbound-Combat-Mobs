name: Sample Mob(must match model name in resources)

# base mob in all caps, with _ for spaces (e.g. CHICKEN, ZOMBIE_VILLAGER, ENDER_DRAGON)
# mob follows base mob's behavior unless specified otherwise, ie:
# use flying mob as base if you want it to fly
# use tameable mob as base if you want it to be tamed
# use mob that can use weapons and wear armor as base if you want mob to do those things
base:

# mob type tells the plugin what kind of mob it is
# other types are: neutral, aggressive, boss
type: passive

# defines custom behavior for this mob
# if omitted, mob will behave like base mob when spawned, but WILL NOT SPAWN NATURALLY
behavior:
  # defines spawning-related behavior
  # if omitted, mob will not spawn naturally
  spawning:
    # specify which worlds the mob is allowed to spawn "naturally"
    # if omitted, mob will use spawning.worlds in config.yml
    # NOTE: if a world name does not exist, this will fail silently
    worlds: [ world ]

    # defines the order in which the mob is spawned in relation to other custom mobs of the same base
    # this is only used in spawning strategies using the "vanilla" mob spawning trigger (e.g. the "replace" strategy)

    # if omitted, mob will only spawn in declared biomes
    default:
      # defines what spawning strategy to use, which determines when a "spawn event" happens
      # replace (default) - spawns in place of base mob when conditions are met (if base mob doesn't spawn in biome, custom mob will not spawn)
      # forced - spawns in whenever the conditions are met (frequency of "spawn checks" are set by spawning.forced-spawns-frequency tag in config.yml)
      # <custom_strategy_name> - use this when you want to set a custom spawning strategy declared in config.yml under spawning.custom-strategies
